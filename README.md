# utility_subtitle-offset-adjust

This project is a text parser that will 

01. Parse text subtitle files
02. Timeshift text subtitle files by any number of minutes, seconds, or milliseconds

I just finished parsing in the hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds as lists of strings so I'll be starting on the math functions as soon as I get some time.
